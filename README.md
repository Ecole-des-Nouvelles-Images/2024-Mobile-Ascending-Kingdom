# Introduction
**Ascending Kingdom** is a video game project inspired by **Tricky Towers** and with some **Rogue-Lite** inspirations. 
Created by 3 students in 3rd years of video game & realtime from the **École des Nouvelles Images**.

# Devloppement Team
- **Elias Prévost** : Product Ower / Programmation
- **Vincent Ménéroud** : Programmation / Tech Art (Particles, VFX, Shaders) / Music
- **Cyrielle Eschalier** : 2D Art / 3D art

# Pitch
In **Ascending Kingdom** you must stack bricks and castle parts to build the tallest tower possible. There is no victory per se other than breaking your own record. The games are enhanced by **random events** as well as a system of **gifts** which can be both bonuses and penalties.
